-- CREATE an object called "myMap" with properties:
--   - coordinates (empty array)
--   - businesses (empty array)
--   - map (empty object)
--   - markers (empty object)
--   - a method called "buildMap" that:
--     - SETS the "map" property to a new map centered on the "coordinates" property with a zoom level of 11
--     - ADDS a tile layer using OpenStreetMap to the "map" property
--     - ADDS a marker to the "map" property at the "coordinates" location

-- DEFINE a function called "getCoords" that:
--   - RETRIEVES the user's current location
--   - RETURNS the latitude and longitude as an array

-- DEFINE a function called "getFoursquare" that takes in a "business" parameter
--   - MAKES a GET request to the Foursquare Places API to search for the "business" within a certain radius from the user's location
--   - RETURNS an array of businesses as a result

-- DEFINE a function called "processBusinesses" that takes in a "data" parameter
--   - PROCESSES the "data" by extracting the name, latitude, and longitude for each business
--   - RETURNS an array of objects containing this information

-- ON window load:
--   - CALL the "getCoords" function and SET the "coordinates" property of "myMap" to the returned value
--   - CALL the "buildMap" method to create the map

-- ADD an event listener to the submit button to listen for a click event
--   - WHEN the event occurs, LOG the value of the "business" input field to the console
